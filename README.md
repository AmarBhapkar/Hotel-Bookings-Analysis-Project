# Hotel-Bookings-Analysis-Project
**Business Context**

•	Booking.com operates at the forefront of global hospitality, managing a diverse range of hotel bookings across various locations, customer profiles, and booking channels. This dataset provides an extensive look into their booking operations, capturing key details such as booking lead times, arrival dates, meal plans, room types, and customer preferences. It also includes information on booking channels, special requests, and reservation statuses.

•	In the competitive landscape of travel and accommodation, companies like booking.com must continuously refine their booking processes to enhance customer satisfaction and optimize revenue. The dataset offers valuable insights into how different factors—such as the booking window, guest demographics, and reservation types—affect hotel performance and customer experience. By analysing this data, booking.com aims to improve booking efficiency, predict guest needs, and tailor their offerings to better meet market demands. This strategic approach helps streamline operations, maximize occupancy rates, and deliver exceptional service, ensuring a competitive edge in the dynamic hospitality industry.

**Objective**

•	This EDA capstone project aims to extract meaningful insights from hotel booking data to improve decision-making in the hospitality industry. We will analyse booking trends, cancellations, pricing strategies, and customer preferences to provide actionable recommendations for optimizing occupancy rates, revenue, and customer satisfaction. 

**Project Summary**

•	For this hotel booking analysis, purpose of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) was to explore the hotel booking data set and identify potential relationships between key variables. As part of the analysis, descriptive statistics were calculated for each variable, and visualizations were created. To get insight from the dataset, we built a variety of charts, including a count plot, bar plot and boxplot. Dataset variables are in int64, float64, and object datatypes. We performed some feature engineering for more convenience and created new variables: total_stays, total_people, total_bookings. From these insights, we can suggest some business objectives to clients.

**Dataset**

This dataset contains information on records for client stays at hotels. More specifically, it contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the guest are coming for first time, number of days in waiting list, among other things. For the purpose of this post, we only focused on some of these variables to examine.
